# BASIC-Sinclair-BASIC
Conversions of BASIC programs to Sinclair BASIC

Contained here will be some simple BASIC programs that have been converted from other BASIC dialects
such as Microsoft BASIC to run on Sinclair a.k.a. ZX BASIC, for use on a Sinclair ZX Spectrum home computer or
one of it's many emulators.

The programs therefore will not be an exact copy of the original BASIC file, as the ZX versions are adapted for the
Spectrum's screen resolution where appropriate. The original .BAS files are also included where available.

The .TZX files will run directly in an emulator, such as F.U.S.E. or Speccy.
The .BAS files were created using BASINC, but can be VIEWED with any text editor.

Adaptations, improvements and updates are welcomed.
